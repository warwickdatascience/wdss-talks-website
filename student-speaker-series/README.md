## FAQs

### What time slots are available for presenting a talk?

We will be running the Student Speaker Series at Wednesday 6pm-7pm on weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 of term 1.

### What is the deadline for applications?

We will be reviewing submissions on a rolling basis so there is no strict deadline.

### How would I present a talk if selected?

You have two options for presenting a talk. The first, and preferred option is to stream the talk live. You would do this by joining a Zoom call we setup and sharing your screen and webcam when it's your turn to present. We will then handle the technical details and stream this feed to our YouTube. We will monitor the stream and be able to pause it if there are any major issues. An alternative approach (for poor internet connectivity, when live-streaming is too intimidating, or when availibility is an issue) is to pre-record a talk for us to play during your slot. In this case, we will still expect you to be free during the talk to answer questions directly into the chat.

### What is the target demographic for talks?

We want our talks to be accessible to all members of the society and so we ask that the content isn't too technical or domain-specific. That isn't to say that you can't discuss such content, just make sure you introduce advanced concepts before using them. If you have an idea that is more applicable to a technical or domain-specifc crowd, reach out to us at [hello@warwickdatascience.com](mailto:hello@warwickdatascience.com) to discuss opportunities for a dedicated talk.

### How long is talk in total/how many speakers will attend?

Each talk will last for around an hour. Taking into account 10 minutes for introductions and closing announcements, this leaves 50 minutes for speakers. Depending on the length of talks this may be split between two to five students.

### What sort of talk material are you looking for?

We are very flexible on content. As long as the material is inline with our code of conduct and relevant to our community, we're likely to approve. For examples of possible talk ideas, see [Example Talks](#example-talks).

### Can I share a link to my talk with employers or on my CV?

Yes! In fact, we encourage it. We will ensure that our videos stay live into the future under almost all circumstances.

### I'm not a University of Warwick student. Can I still present?

As long as you're a student _somewhere_, that's no problem. Just skip out the question relating to university IDs

### Can I present alongside someone else?

Yes, though any more than two people will only be considered under exceptional circumstances due to the complex logistics.

### Will there be a run-through before the talk?

We will have a technical run prior to the talk. This will involve running through the start and end of each person's presentation to check that the tech is working. Running through the entire talk should be done in your own time.

### I have an interesting talk idea that doesn't really fit this format. What can I do?

Reach out to [hello@warwickdatascience.com](mailto:hello@warwickdatascience.com) and we'll be happy to discuss further.

## Example Talks

What follows are three hypothetical talk topics to give an idea of the sort of topics we are looking for. That said, we are open to all ideas so there's no harm in submitting an application that's completely different. Our one exception is that talks should not be used as a platform to promote commercial interests.

### Project-based Talk

_I've recently worked on a project either directly based on data science or on a different disipline in which I've applied data science techniques._

Examples:
- I used a statistical model to analyse chemical spectra
- I performed an analysis on the characteristics of Spotify's top songs
- I used a neural network to classify news articles

### Idea-based Talk

_I've recently come across a cool idea related to data science or a novel application of a technique, and wish to share it with the society._

Examples:
- I've been ready about machine learning ethics and would like to summarise some key ideas
- I've come across this cool technique called isolation forests and would like to showcase how they work
- I've seen an application of regression to signal denoising which could benefit some students to know

### Opportunity-based Talk

_I've got an opportunity related to data science to share or I would like to foster a collaboration._

Examples:
- I've started a project but I need help in pushing it further and so would like to find collaborators
- There is a non-commercial data science competition or hackathon that I would like to raise awareness of
- I'm running a free course or workshop that WDSS members may wish to attend

### Others Talks

If your talk doesn't fit into the above categories, don't sweat it. There is no harm in applying regardless, and we will be happy to put on a different type of talk if we think it would benefit our members.
